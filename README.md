# FirstOpenLayer

With this code, you can see how to generate vector objects associated with meta-data. 
How to store meta-data and constrain them with column models.

### Key Words

Polygon, Meta-Data, Point, Polylines, Data grid, Openlayer, GeoExt, Edition, GIS

## For information

The code provided is the result of a job I was asked to do while I did not master JS. 
The objectives were to make a demonstrator where it was possible to edit and modify data and their associated metadata.

While searching, I did not find a project that allowed me to do it directly. 
That's why I make this code available, hoping it will be used by others to understand how Openlayer works.

I realized this project in 5 days plus 1 for the design.

## For experiment user
Feel free to comment or comment. This will allow me to progress and make this example more meaningful :-).

## For beginner (as me)

Use and test. Tell me in comment if you had any problems.
